The policeman looked behind him at the windows, then at the woman. He placed both hands on the pommel of the saddle and closed his-eyes. After a while the horse moved. It was standing halfway down the street. Then, a moment later, it made a half-turn and once again stood itself at the top of the street. The woman came two steps forward. The horse bent one of its forelegs, then gently lowered it. “Sergeant, please, just let me say two words to him.” His eyes remained closed, his hands motionless on the pommel. Above the wall stretched a fencing of barbed wire at the end of which was a wooden tower. Inside there stood an armed soldier. The woman took another step forward. “ You see, he’s been transferred ...” The sun had passed beyond the central point in the sky. Despite this the weather was still hot. A narrow patch of shade lay at the bottom of the wall. The woman transferred the child to her shoulder. When she again looked at the policeman’s face, she noticed two thin lines of sweat on his forehead. Quietly she moved away from in front of the horse and walked beside the wall. About halfway along it she sat down on a heap of stones opposite the building. The prisoners’ washing, hung by the arms and legs, could be seen. She took the child between her hands and lifted him above her head. She noticed his arms suddenly being withdrawn inside and his hands gripping the iron bars of the window. Then his face disappeared from view. For a while she searched for him among the faces that looked down. She lowered her arms a little and heard shouts of laughter from the window. She spotted his arm once again stretching outwards, then his face appeared clearly in the middle. “Up, Aziza. Up. Face him towards the sun so I can see him.” She lowered her arms for a moment, then raised him up again, turning his face towards the sun. The child closed his eyes and burst out crying. “He’s crying.” He turned round, laughing. “The boy’s crying! The little so-and-so! Aziza, woman, keep him crying!”He cupped his hand round his mouth and shouted, “Let him cry!”Again he laughed. A few shouts went up around him. She heard their words and shouting. Then she saw his large nose poking out through the bars,“Woman! Don’t be silly, that’s enough! Cover tile boy- he’ll get sunstroke!”She hugged the child to her chest and saw the soldier withdrawing inside the tower,“Did you prune the two date palms?”""",
            """She shook her head. “Why not? Why don’t you talk? I’m being transferred. Pass by Abu Ismail and tell him I send him my best wishes. He’ll do it as a favour and prune the trees, then you can bring along a few dates. Did you bring the cigarettes?”She made a sign with her hand. “Talk. What are you saying?” “You’ve got ‘em,” “Louder, woman.” “You’ve got ‘em, I sent them to you.” “When?” “Just Now.” Her face was against the sun. She shifted her head-veil slightly from her head. “They took a couple of packets. Never mind, Aziza. Never mind.” He laughed. His voice had become calm. The other faces disappeared from above him, only a single face remaining alongside his. “Did you build the wall?” “Not yet.” “Why not?” “When Uncle Ahmed lights the furnace, I’ll get some bricks from him.” “All right. Be careful on the tram. Look after the boy.” She remained standing. “Anything you want?” “No.” She gazed at his face, his large nose, his bare arms. She smiled. The face next to him smiled back. Suddenly be shouted. “Did you get the letter? I’m being transferred.” “Where to?” “I don’t know.” “When?” “You see, they’re pulling down the prison.” “Where will you go?” “God knows-anywhere. No one knows.” “When?” “In two or three days. Don’t come here again. I’ll let you know when I’m transferred. Has the boy gone to sleep?” “No, he’s awake.” He stared back for a while in silence. “Aziza !” Again there was silence. The face alongside his smiled, then slowly slid back inside and disappeared. Her husband remained silent, his arms around the bars. Suddenly he glanced behind him and quickly drew in his arms. He signalled to her to move away, then disappeared from the window. She stepped back, though she remained standing looking up at the window.   """

            """The country is India.  A large dinner party is being given in an up-country station by a colonial official and his wife.  The guests are army officers and government attaches and their wives, and an American naturalist. At one side of the long table a spirited discussion springs  up between a young girl and a colonel.  The girl insists women have long outgrown the jumping-on-a-chair-at-the-sight-of-a-mouse  era, that they are not as fluttery as their grandmothers.  The colonel says they are, explaining women haven't the actual nerve control of men.  The other men at the table agree with him. "A woman's unfailing reaction in any crisis, " the colonel says, "is to scream.  And while a man may feel  like it, yet he  has that  ounce  more  of  control  than a woman has.  And that last ounce is what counts. """",
            """The American scientist does  not  join  in  the  argument but sits and watches the faces of the other guests.  As he looks,  he  sees a strange expression come over the face of the hostess.  She  is staring  straight ahead,  the muscles of her face contracting  slightly.  With a small gesture she summons the native boy standing behind her chair.  She whispers to him.  The boy's eyes widen: he   turns quickly and leaves  the  room.  No one else sees this, nor the boy when he puts a bowl of milk on the verandah outside the glass doors. The American comes to with a start.  In India, milk in a bowl means only one thing.  It is bait  for a  snake.  He  realizes there is a cobra  in  the room.He  looks   up   at  the  rafters-the   likeliest   place - and sees they  are  bare.  Three corners of the  room, which he can see by shifting only slightly, are empty.  In the fourth corner a group of servants stand, waiting until the next course can be served.  The American realizes there is only one place left - under the table.""",
            """His first impulse is to jump back and warn the others.  But he knows the commotion will frighten the cobra and it will strike.  He speaks quickly, the quality of his voice so arresting that it sobers everyone. "I want to know just what control everyone at this table has.  I will count three hundred - that's five minutes - and not one of you is to move a single muscle.  The persons who move will forfeit 50 rupees.  Now!  Ready!" The 20 people sit like stone images while he counts.  He is saying ". . . two hundred and eighty . . ." when, out of the corner of his eye, he sees the cobra emerge and make for the bowl of milk.  Four or five screams ring out as he jumps to slam shut the verandah doors. "You certainly were right, Colonel!" the host says.  "A man has just shown us an example of real control." "Just a minute," the American says, turning to his hostess, "there's one thing I'd like to know.  Mrs. Wynnes, how did you know that cobra was in the room?" A faint smile lights up the woman's face as she replies.  "Because it was lying across my foot.""""
